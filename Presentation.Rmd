Talk title: Using Shiny to Visualize Hypothetical Regional Proportional Representation

Short abstract: The last two Canadian federal elections have resulted in a situation where the party that wins the most seats (and forms government) but not a plurality of the popular vote. This has renewed calls for change away the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system. This talk aims to examine hypothetical results if FPTP were changed to two forms of Proportional Representation at the regional level.

## Shortcomings of Dashboard

- Party strategy will necessarily be different under any form of PR. For instance, the Alba Party only ran list (additional PR MSPs) candidates in the May 2021 Scottish Parliament election.
- Does not consider seats at dissolution / dropping of writ; election broadcast coverage change is reported relative to that instead of the prior election
- Does not take into account redistributions

- May inaccurately account for removals of candidates by the parties after the ballot deadline, e.g. Spadinaâ€”Fort York in the 2021 snap election.
