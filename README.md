This repository is for a presentation that I gave at [Data Science Philly](https://www.meetup.com/dataphilly/events/287493800/) on 18 Aug 2022 and a visualization idea that I intend to work intermittently on.

To download the same dataset for candidate information by riding (constituency), go to [Parliament site](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/ElectionsRidings/Elections), filter "Type of Elections" to "General", in "Column Chooser", uncheck "Picture"

The packages used in the `.R` scripts are standard, and only require `install.packages()` to use.
